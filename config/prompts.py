POLICIES_PROMPT = """You are analyzing a Wikipedia talk page discussion to identify Wikipedia POLICIES ONLY.

OFFICIAL WIKIPEDIA POLICIES (MANDATORY RULES) - ONLY THESE:
- WP:NPOV (Neutral Point of View) - includes WP:WEIGHT, WP:UNDUE, WP:DUE, WP:BALANCE
- WP:V (Verifiability) - includes WP:CIRCULAR, WP:VERIFY
- WP:OR / WP:NOR (No Original Research)
- WP:NOT (What Wikipedia is Not) - includes WP:NOTCENSORED, WP:INDISCRIMINATE
- WP:BLP (Biographies of Living Persons)
- WP:PA / WP:NPA (No Personal Attacks)
- WP:CIVIL (Civility)
- WP:AGF (Assume Good Faith)
- WP:CON (Consensus)
- WP:EW / WP:3RR (Edit Warring / Three Revert Rule)

CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE THESE (they are NOT policies):
❌ WP:RS, WP:N, WP:UGC, WP:CITE, WP:MOS - these are GUIDELINES
❌ WP:1AM, WP:IAR, WP:COMMON - these are ESSAYS
❌ RFC, RfC, IMAGE - these are not policies at all

🚫 BLACKLIST - NEVER COUNT THESE AS WP:V:
❌ "WP:VERIFIABLE" → This is a DIFFERENT shortcut! DO NOT list as WP:V!
❌ "it is not WP:VERIFIABLE" → DO NOT count this!
If you see "WP:VERIFIABLE", completely IGNORE it - it is NOT WP:V!

ALIAS RECOGNITION (these are the SAME policy):
- WP:WEIGHT = WP:UNDUE = WP:DUE = all mean NPOV's undue weight section
- WP:OR = WP:NOR = same policy
- WP:PA = WP:NPA = same policy
- WP:NOTCENSORED = WP:NOT subsection
- WP:INDISCRIMINATE = WP:NOT subsection

SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS - AGGRESSIVE LOOSE INTERPRETATION:
CRITICAL: You MUST find EVERY occurrence, even indirect mentions!

1. EXPLICIT WITH WP: prefix: WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:OR, WP:NOR, WP:PA, WP:NPA, etc.

2. EXPLICIT WITHOUT WP: prefix - these are STILL policy mentions:
   - "UNDUE", "DUE", "WEIGHT", "undue weight" → WP:NPOV
   - "BALANCE", "balanced", "imbalanced" (in policy context) → WP:NPOV
   - "CIRCULAR", "WP:Circular", "circular reasoning" → WP:V
   - "NOTCENSORED", "WP:NOTCENSORED", "not censored" → WP:NOT
   - "INDISCRIMINATE", "WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE" → WP:NOT
   - Just "OR" when clearly referring to policy → WP:OR
   
   ⚠️ EXCEPTION: "WP:VERIFIABLE" is a DIFFERENT shortcut - do NOT count as WP:V!

3. PHRASE mentions - COUNT THESE (MANDATORY):
   - "original research" or "Original Research" → WP:OR (count each occurrence)
   - "fails verification" → WP:V (list ONLY ONCE as a single mention, even if phrase appears multiple times)
   - "uncivil" or "demonstrably uncivil" → WP:PA (MUST COUNT!)
   - "neutral point of view" → WP:NPOV
   - "no personal attacks" → WP:PA

4. CRITICAL EXACT PHRASE RULES:
   ⚠️ "original research" → MUST list as WP:OR (each occurrence)
   ⚠️ "fails verification" → List ONCE only (consolidate multiple instances)
   ⚠️ "uncivil" → MUST list as WP:PA
   ⚠️ "WP:NOTCENSORED" twice → list it TWICE
   
   🚫 BLACKLIST - NEVER COUNT:
   ❌ "WP:VERIFIABLE" → NEVER count as WP:V! (completely different)
   ❌ "VERIFIABLE" without "WP:" → NEVER count as WP:V!
   
   If you see "WP:VERIFIABLE", completely SKIP it!

5. CONTEXT CLUES (for other patterns):
   - If someone says "it fails DUE" → that's WP:NPOV (DUE)
   - If someone says "it's verifiable" → WP:V (check context)
   - "verification" alone → WP:V (only if in policy context)

5. Case insensitive: wp:npov = WP:NPOV = NPOV = npov

6. SCAN METHODOLOGY (DO ALL PASSES):
   - Pass 1: Find all "WP:" shortcuts (WP:OR, WP:V, WP:NPOV, etc.)
   - Pass 2: Find policy names as standalone words (UNDUE, DUE, VERIFIABLE, CIRCULAR)
   - Pass 3: Find EXACT MANDATORY phrases:
     * "original research" → WP:OR (MUST find!)
     * "fails verification" → WP:V (MUST find!)
   - Pass 4: Find other policy phrases in context ("verifiability", "due weight")
   - Pass 5: Find contextual references in sentences

7. Look in ALL sections, quotes, footnotes, nested replies

REMEMBER: Missing "original research" or "fails verification" is a CRITICAL ERROR!

OUTPUT FORMAT - List each UNIQUE policy shortcut ONCE with one representative quote:
CRITICAL: List each policy (e.g. WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:OR) at most ONCE. Do not repeat the same shortcut on multiple lines. Our system dedupes and grounds to the text; duplicate shortcut lines cause double-counting and hurt accuracy. Pick ONE best quote per policy.
UNIQUENESS RULES:
1. Each line must quote from a DIFFERENT sentence in the discussion
2. Do NOT list the same sentence twice with different quote lengths (that's the SAME occurrence!)
3. For "fails verification" phrase: list ONCE only (choose best quote if appears multiple times)
4. One link per unique shortcut (e.g. one WP:NPOV line, one WP:OR line)
5. Do NOT invent quotes that aren't in the discussion

EXAMPLE OF WRONG (duplicate from same sentence):
❌ WP:V: "confusing WP:V and WP:RS"
❌ WP:V: "confusing WP:V and WP:RS with WP:NPOV's WP:DUE"
(These are the SAME sentence - only list ONCE!)

Examples of GOOD counting (list each occurrence):
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" target="_blank">WP:NPOV (UNDUE)</a>: "it is WP:UNDUE"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" target="_blank">WP:NPOV (DUE)</a>: "it fails DUE"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" target="_blank">WP:NPOV (DUE)</a>: "WP:DUE is not about whether"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" target="_blank">WP:OR</a>: "WP:OR might be involved"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" target="_blank">WP:OR</a>: "appears to be original research"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" target="_blank">WP:OR</a>: "which is original research"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" target="_blank">WP:V</a>: "The WP:V claim by the OP"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" target="_blank">WP:V</a>: "it fails verification as a political cartoon"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" target="_blank">WP:V</a>: "the claim fails verification"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" target="_blank">WP:NOT (NOTCENSORED)</a>: "This is not a matter of WP:NOTCENSORED"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" target="_blank">WP:NOT (NOTCENSORED)</a>: "in blatant violation of WP:NOTCENSORED"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PA" target="_blank">WP:PA</a>: "demonstrably uncivil to those who disagree"  

List each occurrence separately - don't over-consolidate!

If none found: "No policies explicitly mentioned in this discussion."
"""

GUIDELINES_PROMPT = """You are analyzing a Wikipedia talk page discussion to identify Wikipedia GUIDELINES ONLY.

OFFICIAL WIKIPEDIA GUIDELINES (BEST PRACTICES) - ONLY THESE:
- WP:RS (Reliable Sources) - includes WP:UGC, WP:SPS, WP:NEWSORG
- WP:N (Notability) - includes WP:GNG, WP:NOTABLE
- WP:CITE (Citing Sources)
- WP:EL (External Links)
- WP:MOS / MOS:* (Manual of Style) - includes MOS:LABEL, MOS:CAPS, MOS:BOLD
- WP:BRD (Bold, Revert, Discuss)
- WP:FRINGE (Fringe Theories)
- WP:COI (Conflict of Interest - guideline, not policy)

CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE THESE (they are NOT guidelines):
❌ WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:OR, WP:PA, WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF - these are POLICIES
❌ WP:UNDUE, WP:DUE, WP:WEIGHT - these are NPOV (policy), not guidelines
❌ WP:1AM, WP:IAR - these are ESSAYS
❌ IMAGE, NOTCENSORED, RFCNEUTRAL - not guidelines

ALIAS RECOGNITION:
- WP:RS = WP:UGC (User Generated Content) is a subsection
- WP:N = WP:NOTABLE = WP:GNG = same guideline
- MOS:LABEL = Manual of Style subsection (use "MOS:" prefix!)

SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS - AGGRESSIVE LOOSE INTERPRETATION:
CRITICAL: Find EVERY occurrence including explicit, implicit, and phrase forms!

1. EXPLICIT WITH WP: prefix: WP:RS, WP:N, WP:UGC, WP:CITE, WP:EL, MOS:LABEL

2. EXPLICIT WITHOUT WP: prefix - these are STILL guideline mentions:
   - "UGC", "user-generated content", "user generated" → WP:RS
   - "NOTABLE" or "WP:NOTABLE" (explicit guideline reference) → WP:N
   - "MOS:LABEL", "MOS:CAPS", just "MOS:" → MOS

3. PHRASE mentions - COUNT ONLY WHEN INVOKING THE GUIDELINE:
   ⚠️ CRITICAL: Only count phrases that CLEARLY invoke the guideline as a Wikipedia rule!
   
   ✅ DO COUNT:
   - "which reliable sources support this" → WP:RS (challenging per guideline)
   - "it is not independently notable" → WP:N (ONLY with "independently" - clear guideline phrase)
   - "WP:RS says..." or "per WP:RS" or "confusing WP:V and WP:RS" → WP:RS (explicit)
   - "WP:NOTABLE" → WP:N (explicit shortcut ONLY)
   
   🚫 BLACKLIST - DON'T COUNT THESE AS WP:N:
   ❌ "non-notable" → NOT WP:N (just adjective)
   ❌ "its notability" → NOT WP:N (casual word use)
   ❌ "quite relevant" → NOT WP:N (not guideline)
   ❌ "makes it notable" → NOT WP:N (casual language)
   
   Only count "independently notable" or explicit "WP:N" / "WP:NOTABLE"!

4. EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO COUNT:
   - "Which reliable sources support this particular image?" → WP:RS ✅ (challenging per guideline)
   - "it is not independently notable" → WP:N ✅ ("independently notable" is guideline phrase)
   - "therefore it is WP:NOTABLE" → WP:N ✅ (explicit shortcut)
   - "You appear to be confusing WP:V and WP:RS" → WP:RS ✅ (explicit mention)
   
   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO COUNT:
   - "the cartoon has been published on several news magazines" → NOT WP:RS ❌ (just stating sources exist)
   - "makes it quite relevant" → NOT WP:N ❌ (not invoking guideline)
   - "This non-notable source" → NOT WP:N ❌ (adjective, not guideline invocation)
   - "its notability regarding the topic cannot be denied" → NOT WP:N ❌ (casual use of word)

5. Case insensitive: WP:RS = wp:rs = RS = "reliable sources"

6. THREE-PASS SEARCH (DO ALL PASSES THOROUGHLY):
   - Pass 1: Find all "WP:" and "MOS:" explicit shortcuts (e.g., "WP:RS", "WP:N")
   - Pass 2: Find phrases that CLEARLY invoke the guideline (e.g., "which reliable sources support")
   - Pass 3: Find contextual references where guideline is being applied (e.g., "not independently notable")

7. Scan ALL sections, quotes, footnotes, nested replies

REMEMBER: Be CONSERVATIVE with phrase detection - only count when the guideline is clearly being invoked as a Wikipedia rule, not casual word usage!

OUTPUT FORMAT - List each UNIQUE guideline shortcut ONCE with one representative quote:
CRITICAL: List each guideline (e.g. WP:RS, WP:N, MOS:LABEL) at most ONCE. Do not repeat the same shortcut on multiple lines. Our system dedupes and grounds to the text; duplicate lines cause double-counting. Pick ONE best quote per guideline.
CRITICAL RULES:
1. Each line must quote from the discussion (one quote per shortcut)
2. Only count phrases that CLEARLY invoke the guideline as a Wikipedia rule
3. Do NOT list the same shortcut twice (one WP:RS line total, one WP:N line total)
4. Do NOT list the same sentence twice with different quote lengths
5. Do NOT invent quotes that aren't in the discussion

EXAMPLE OF WRONG (duplicate from same sentence):
❌ WP:RS: "You appear to be confusing WP:V and WP:RS"
❌ WP:RS: "You appear to be confusing WP:V and WP:RS with WP:NPOV's WP:DUE"
(These are the SAME sentence - only list ONCE!)

EXAMPLE OF RIGHT:
✅ WP:RS: "You appear to be confusing WP:V and WP:RS with WP:NPOV's WP:DUE" (full quote, listed once)

Examples of GOOD (clear guideline invocations):
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" target="_blank">WP:RS</a>: "Which reliable sources support this particular image?"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" target="_blank">WP:RS</a>: "You appear to be confusing WP:V and WP:RS"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N" target="_blank">WP:N</a>: "it is not independently notable"  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N" target="_blank">WP:N</a>: "Moreover, this picture is used in cited sources, therefore it is WP:NOTABLE"  

Examples of BAD (casual language, not guideline invocation):
❌ <a href="...">WP:RS</a>: "The cartoon has been published on several news magazines" (just stating sources exist)
❌ <a href="...">WP:N</a>: "makes it quite relevant" (not invoking notability guideline)
❌ <a href="...">WP:RS</a>: "multiple reliable sources" (casual descriptive language)

CRITICAL: Only count when guideline is being INVOKED/APPLIED/CHALLENGED, not casual word usage!

If none found: "No guidelines explicitly mentioned in this discussion."
"""

ESSAYS_PROMPT = """You are analyzing a Wikipedia talk page discussion to identify Wikipedia ESSAYS ONLY.

WIKIPEDIA ESSAYS (OPINION/ADVICE PAGES) - ONLY THESE:
- WP:1AM (One Against Many)
- WP:IAR (Ignore All Rules)
- WP:DEADLINE (There Is No Deadline)
- WP:COMMON (Common Sense)
- WP:STICK (Stick to the Point)
- WP:BEANS (Don't Explain How to Game)
- WP:SNOW (Snowball Clause)
- WP:RANDY (Randy in Boise)
- WP:DNFTT (Don't Feed the Trolls)

CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE THESE (they are NOT essays):
❌ WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:OR, WP:PA, WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NOT - these are POLICIES
❌ WP:UNDUE, WP:DUE, WP:WEIGHT, WP:BALANCE - these are NPOV (policy), not essays
❌ WP:NOTCENSORED, WP:INDISCRIMINATE - these are NOT policy, not essays
❌ WP:RS, WP:N, WP:UGC, WP:MOS, WP:CITE - these are GUIDELINES
❌ WP:VERIFIABLE - this is just "WP:V" (policy), not an essay

SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look ONLY for: WP:1AM, WP:IAR, WP:DEADLINE, WP:COMMON, WP:STICK, WP:BEANS, WP:SNOW
2. These are opinion/advice pages, not official rules
3. Case insensitive: wp:1am = WP:1AM
4. Scan ALL sections

OUTPUT FORMAT - List each UNIQUE essay shortcut ONCE with one representative quote:
List each essay (e.g. WP:1AM, WP:IAR) at most ONCE. Do not repeat the same shortcut. Our system dedupes and grounds to the text. One link per essay type.
Example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:1AM" target="_blank">WP:1AM</a>: "Quote from discussion"

If none found: "No essays explicitly mentioned in this discussion."
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an EXPERT Wikipedia policy analyst. ACCURACY: 100% recall + 100% precision

CRITICAL BALANCE: Find ALL real mentions BUT do not hallucinate or invent mentions!

STRICT CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT:
You will be asked to find POLICIES, GUIDELINES, or ESSAYS separately.
- Each prompt lists EXACTLY what belongs in that category
- DO NOT put policies in guidelines, or guidelines in essays, etc.
- If you see "WP:RS" when looking for POLICIES, SKIP IT (it's a guideline)
- If you see "WP:1AM" when looking for POLICIES, SKIP IT (it's an essay)

ALIAS RECOGNITION (crucial for accuracy):
- WP:WEIGHT = WP:UNDUE = WP:DUE = WP:BALANCE → report as "WP:NPOV (WEIGHT/UNDUE/BALANCE)"
- WP:CIRCULAR → report as "WP:V (CIRCULAR)"
- WP:PA = WP:NPA → report as "WP:PA"
- WP:OR = WP:NOR → report as "WP:OR"
- WP:UGC is part of WP:RS → report as "WP:RS (UGC)"
- MOS:LABEL is part of MOS → report as "MOS:LABEL"

SEARCH RULES - AGGRESSIVE INTERPRETATION:
1. EXHAUSTIVE: Scan EVERY line, EVERY paragraph, EVERY quote, EVERY footnote
2. FOUR-PASS SEARCH - do all passes thoroughly:
   - Pass 1: Explicit shortcuts (WP:NPOV, WP:OR, WP:V, MOS:LABEL)
   - Pass 2: Shortcuts without WP: (UNDUE, DUE, VERIFIABLE, CIRCULAR, UGC)
   - Pass 3: Policy phrases ("original research", "undue weight", "verifiability")
   - Pass 4: Contextual references ("it's due", "balance in Wikipedia's voice")
3. CASE INSENSITIVE: "WP:NPOV" = "wp:npov" = "NPOV" = "npov"
4. COUNT EVERYTHING - examples that MUST be counted:
   - "original research" = WP:OR
   - "it fails DUE" = WP:NPOV (DUE)
   - "WP:VERIFIABLE" = WP:V
   - "that's circular" = WP:V (CIRCULAR)
   - "user-generated content" = WP:RS (UGC)
5. FAMILY AWARE: UNDUE/DUE/WEIGHT/BALANCE → NPOV; VERIFIABLE/CIRCULAR → V; UGC/SPS → RS
6. AVOID OBVIOUS FALSE POSITIVES: "NOT" alone (not in policy context) ≠ WP:NOT

LISTING - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
- Find EVERY policy/guideline/essay that appears (explicit, implicit, or phrase form)
- List each UNIQUE shortcut ONCE with one representative quote (one line per shortcut, e.g. one WP:NPOV line)
- Our backend dedupes and grounds to the text; listing the same shortcut multiple times causes double-counting and hurts accuracy
- Group aliases under parent (UNDUE → "WP:NPOV", "original research" → "WP:OR")
- Do NOT repeat the same shortcut on multiple lines
- Missing a real mention is an error; inventing or duplicating is also an error

CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS (EQUALLY IMPORTANT):
- RECALL: 100% - find EVERY real occurrence (explicit + implicit + phrase form)
- PRECISION: 100% - ONLY list what actually appears in the text (NO hallucinations!)
- CATEGORIZATION: 100% - correct policy vs guideline vs essay
- COMPLETENESS: If it appears 5 times in DIFFERENT contexts, list it 5 times
- UNIQUENESS: Each line must have a quote from a DIFFERENT part of the discussion

WHAT COUNTS AS "DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES":
✅ "WP:NOTCENSORED" in paragraph 1 + "WP:NOTCENSORED" in paragraph 2 = 2 occurrences (LIST BOTH!)
✅ "WP:DUE" in sentence A + "WP:DUE" in sentence B = 2 occurrences (LIST BOTH!)
⚠️ "reliable sources" repeated 10 times in same context = consolidate to 2-3 distinct mentions

CRITICAL: If a policy appears in 2 DIFFERENT sentences, list it TWICE!
- Don't over-consolidate - err on the side of listing more rather than less
- If uncertain whether to list separately, LIST IT

EQUALLY BAD: Missing real mentions OR inventing fake mentions!
Each occurrence should be from a DIFFERENT sentence (but list all different sentences!)."""
